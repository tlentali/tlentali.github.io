When I was a kid I wanted to become a bicycle repairman. 
Now I am working as a freelance software and research engineer, which has its perks too. 
I have a masters degree in AI and experience in various fields such as astronomy, big data, industrial computing, fin tech, machine learning and computer vision. 
For the last five years I have worked on data reduction pipelines for large radio telescopes like LOFAR and SKA. 
Amsterdam is home, but I am often in Cape Town. 
In my spare time I brew beer and make electronic music. 
My name is Gijs Molenaar.

```text
I’m Chip Huyen, a writer and computer scientist. I grew up chasing grasshoppers in a small rice-farming village in Vietnam.

I’m a co-founder of Claypot AI, a platform for real-time machine learning. Previously, I built machine learning tools at NVIDIA, Snorkel AI, Netflix, and Primer.

I graduated from Stanford University, where I taught CS 329S: Machine Learning Systems Design. My O’Reilly book Designing Machine Learning Systems is an Amazon #1 bestseller in Artificial Intelligence (very proud)!

LinkedIn included me among Top Voices in Software Development (2019) and Top Voices in Data Science & AI (2020).

In my free time, I travel and write. After high school, I went to Brunei for a 3-day vacation which turned into a 3-year trip through Asia, Africa, and South America. During my trip, I worked as a Bollywood extra, a casino hostess, and a street performer.

I spend a lot of time learning about machine learning production, and I maintain a Discord server to learn together with people who share similar interests. As of May 2023, it’s the largest online MLOps community with over 16,000 members. Join us if you want to learn too!

Most of my technical work is on GitHub. Some of my other projects:

    Books: I’ve published four best-selling Vietnamese books
    VietAI: a nonprofit working to educate future AI talent about AI for social good
    Free Hugs Vietnam: a nonprofit that provides soft skills for Vietnamese youths
    VnExpress’ Góc Nhìn: I occasionally contribute opinions on tech and culture
    StanfordIRL: chronicle of the amazing things people do after Stanford
    Trying to make these 11 cute but kinda rude alpacas love me
    I helped launch Cốc Cốc - Vietnam’s second most popular web browser with 20+ million monthly active users.

I’m best reached via email. I’m always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
