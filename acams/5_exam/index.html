E. The holding company is in Country A with a bank account in one of the international banks.
</code></pre>
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Correct Answer: BC </br>
Explanation -
High-risk: The risks here are significant, but are not necessarily prohibited. To mitigate the heightened risk presented, the financial institution should apply more stringent controls to reduce the ML/FT risk, such as conducting enhanced due diligence and more rigorous transaction monitoring. Countries that maintain a reputation for corruption or drug trafficking are generally considered high-risk. High-risk customers may include politically exposed persons
(PEPs) or certain types of money services businesses or cash-intensive businesses; high-risk products and services may include correspondent banking and private banking.
