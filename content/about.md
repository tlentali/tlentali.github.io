I am a Data Scientist at [Betclic](https://www.betclic.fr/) ⛹️, where I specialize in building machine learning detection models mainly for [safer gaming](https://www.joueurs-info-service.fr/) (risk of gambling addiction) 🎰 and [anti-money laundering](https://www.acams.org/en) 💸 behavior (currently certified [CAMS](https://www.acams.org/en)). Previously, I worked for [Cdiscount](https://www.cdiscount.com/), a French 🐓 e-commerce company 🛒, focusing mainly on search engine relevancy 🔍.

My educational background is in applied mathematics 🧮, with a Master's degree 🎓 that focused on [optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization) 📈, [operations research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research) 📊, and [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) 🤖. I studied at both [Bordeaux](https://www.u-bordeaux.fr/) and [Toulon](https://www.univ-tln.fr/) universities in France 🇫🇷, where my studies included a mix of pure and applied maths ➕, economics 💰, and computer science 🖥️. In 2015, I became passionate about data science during an internship at [Idaia Group](https://www.idaia.group/en/), where I participated in a [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) 🖊️ competition on datascience.net 💻.

Programming is a passion of mine, and I actively participate in [open-source](https://github.com/tlentali) projects ⚙️. I'm proud to have earned the [Kaggle competitions Expert](https://www.kaggle.com/tlentali) trophy 🏆 and enjoy competitive data science. I also like helping my peers on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/8479387/tlentali) 🤝 and teaching AI & Ethics 🧑‍🏫 at [Kedge Business School](https://kedge.edu/) and Python programming initiation 🐍 at [INSEEC](https://www.inseec.com/en/) Bordeaux.

On my free time, you can find me surfing 🏄‍♂️, soldering things 👨‍🏭, motorcycling 🏍️ and reviewing restaurants in Bordeaux 🍽️.
