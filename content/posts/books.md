Books.  
They accumulate slowly but surely in my home.  
Books that I haven't read of course.  
We need a plan to optimize my reading process.  
Nothing on **Arxiv** about optimized reading book in a special order, nothing on **Google**...  
However, **ChatGPT** advises us to prioritize short books in order to keep a sens of accomplishment.  
But, when I finished all the small reads, the problem stay the same : how do I read this tone of books ?  
Ok, we need a blend of the **ChatGPT** approche and a little bit of common sense.  
We need to slalom, we need to temperate : we need to alternte between book size.  

### First, the data.

I have 21 pending books.  
There is a sample of our books, with there title and page number :

```text
| title                                         |   pages |
|:----------------------------------------------|--------:|
| Fondation                                     |     832 |
| Cracking the Coding Interview                 |     706 |
| Contes et l√©gendes du vieux Bordeaux          |     143 |
```

Let's start by getting the data.

```python
import pandas as pd

books = pd.read_csv('waiting_room.csv', index_col='title')
```

Now that our data is loaded, we can answer a couple of obvious question like `how many page should I read on a daily basisi in order to finish everything ?`

```python
books['pages'].sum()/365
```

Around `20` pages a day, seems good to me.  
We can have a look at the volume of page sorted by books and setting this order in term of volume using [`rank`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.rank.html) from Pandas.

```python
books['rank'] = books['pages'].rank(method='first')
```

### A new hope.

we can create a new column `reading_rank` to alternate the ranking as want it.

```python
books.loc[books['rank']>(books['rank'].max()/2), 'reading_rank'] = books[books['rank']>(books['rank'].max()/2)]['pages'].rank(method='first')
books.loc[books['rank']<=(books['rank'].max()/2), 'reading_rank'] = books[books['rank']<=(books['rank'].max()/2)]['pages'].rank(method='first')
```

Reordering the list using [`sort_values`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.sort_values.html) gives us the final result.

```python
books.sort_values(by=['reading_rank','rank'], ascending=False)['pages']
```

Let's call it a plan and start reading ;)
