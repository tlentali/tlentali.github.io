Hi there,

I am a Data Scientist at [Betclic](https://www.betclic.fr/), where I specialize in detecting [safer gaming](https://www.joueurs-info-service.fr/) behavior and developing [anti-money laundering ](https://www.acams.org/en) models. Previously, I worked for [Cdiscount](https://www.cdiscount.com/), a French e-commerce company, focusing mainly on search engine relevancy.

My educational background is in applied mathematics, with a Master's degree that focused on [optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization), [operations research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research), and [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning). I studied at both [Bordeaux](https://www.u-bordeaux.fr/) and [Toulon](https://www.univ-tln.fr/) universities in France, where my studies included a mix of math, economics, and computer science. In 2015, I became passionate about data science during an internship at [Idaia Group](https://www.idaia.group/en/), where I participated in a [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) competition on datascience.net.

Programming is a passion of mine, and I actively participate in [open-source projects](https://github.com/tlentali). I'm proud to have earned the [Kaggle competitions Expert](https://www.kaggle.com/tlentali) trophy and enjoy competitive data science. I also enjoy [helping my peers on Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/8479387/tlentali) and occasionally giving talks.

When I'm not working, you can find me soldering things, motorcycling, surfing, and reviewing all the best restaurants in Bordeaux.

If you want to connect with me, feel free to email me at thomas.lentali@gmail.com.
