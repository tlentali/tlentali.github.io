I am a Data Scientist at [Betclic](https://www.betclic.fr/), where I specialize in building machine learning detection models mainly for [anti-money laundering](https://www.acams.org/en) behavior (currently certified [CAMS](https://www.acams.org/en)) and [safer gaming](https://www.joueurs-info-service.fr/) (risk of gambling addiction). Previously, I worked for [Cdiscount](https://www.cdiscount.com/), a French e-commerce company, focusing mainly on search engine relevancy.

My educational background is in applied mathematics, with a Master's degree that focused on [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), [operations research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research) and [optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization). I studied at both [Bordeaux](https://www.u-bordeaux.fr/) and [Toulon](https://www.univ-tln.fr/) universities in France , where my studies included a mix of pure and applied maths, economics, and computer science. In 2015, I became passionate about data science during an internship at [Idaia Group](https://www.idaia.group/en/), where I participated in a [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) competition on datascience.net.

Programming is a passion of mine, and I actively participate in [open-source](https://github.com/tlentali) projects. I'm proud to have earned the [Kaggle competitions Expert](https://www.kaggle.com/tlentali) trophy and enjoy competitive data science. I also like helping my peers on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/8479387/tlentali) and teaching AI & Ethics at [Kedge Business School](https://kedge.edu/) and Python programming at [INSEEC](https://www.inseec.com/en/) Bordeaux.

On my free time, you can find me surfing, soldering things, motorcycling and reviewing restaurants in Bordeaux.
