<details>
  <summary> What is money laundering?</summary>

Money laundering involves taking criminal
proceeds and disguising their illegal
sources in order to use the funds to perform legal or illegal
activities. Money laundering is the process of making dirty
money look clean
</details>

<details>
<summary>Give an example of the first stage of money laundering.</summary>

Give an example of the first stage of money laundering.
Blending of funds, purchasing significant
stored value cards with currency, foreign
exchange, breaking up amounts, currency smuggling, and
loans.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Give an example of the second stage of money laundering.</summary>

Electronically moving funds from one
country to another and dividing them into
advanced financial options and/or markets; moving funds
from one financial institution to another or within accounts
at the same institution; converting the cash placed into the
system into monetary instruments; reselling high-value
goods and prepaid access or stored value products;
investing in real estate and other legitimate businesses;
placing money in stocks, bonds, or life insurance products;
and using shell companies to obscure the ultimate
beneficial owner and assets.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Give an example of the third stage of money laundering.</summary>

Purchasing luxury assets such as property,
artwork, jewelry, or high-end automobiles;
and entering into financial arrangements and other
ventures in which investments can be made in business
enterprises.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What does the Yates Memo say?</summary>

The Yates memo reminds prosecutors that
criminal and civil investigations into
corporate misconduct should also focus on individuals who
perpetrated the wrongdoing. It notes that the resolution of
a corporate case does not provide protection to individuals
from criminal or civil liability.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are some indicators of money laundering using electronic transfers of funds?</summary>

Funds transfers to or from a financial
secrecy haven or high-risk geographic
location without an apparent business reason or when the
activity is inconsistent with the customer’s business or
history; large, incoming funds transfers on behalf of a
foreign client with little or no explanation or apparent
reason; checks and money orders used to receive many
small, incoming transfers of funds or to make deposits;
funds activity that is unexplained, repetitive, or reveals
unusual patterns; payments or receipts that have no
apparent link to legitimate contracts, goods, or services;
and funds transfers sent or received from the same person
to or from different accounts.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is remote deposit capture and what risk is associated with it?</summary>

Remote deposit capture (RDC) is a bank
product that allows customers to scan a
check and transmit an electronic image to the bank for
deposit. Because RDC minimizes human intervention, it
decreases the ability to identify potential fraud indicators,
such as an altered check and multiple deposits of the same item.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are some of the money laundering risks pertaining to the use of payable through accounts (PTAs)?</summary>

PTAs with foreign institutions licensed in
offshore centers with weak bank
supervision and licensing laws; PTAs arrangements in
which the correspondent bank fails to apply CDD to the
respondent's customers; PTA arrangements in which
subaccount holders have currency deposit and withdrawal
privileges; and PTAs used in conjunction with a subsidiary,
representative, or other office of the respondent bank.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is a money laundering risk pertaining to the use of concentration accounts?</summary>

Money laundering risks can arise in
concentration accounts when the
customer-identifying information is separated from the
financial transaction. When separation occurs, the audit
trail is lost, and accounts can be misused or administered
improperly.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Define a politically exposed person (PEP).</summary>

A PEP is a person who is or has been
entrusted with a prominent public
function domestically or by a foreign country or
international organization. Relatives and close associates of
PEPs are also considered to be PEPs.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is structuring ?</summary>

Structuring is designing a transaction to
evade triggering a reporting or
recordkeeping requirement, e.g., breaking a large cash
deposit into smaller amounts to be deposited into separate
banks, separate accounts, or on separate days to avoid
currency transaction reports.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Which money laundering stage(s) are credit cards most likely to be used, and what is an example of money laundering through the use of credit cards?</summary>

Credit cards are more likely to be used in
the second (layering) and third
(integration) stages of money laundering. Examples include
overpaying a credit card balance and then asking for a
refund and placing illegal funds in accounts at offshore
banks and then accessing the funds using credit and debit
cards associated with the offshore account.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are some of the risks posed by third-party payment processors (TPPPs)?</summary>

Multiple financial organization
relationships, whereby the TPPP’s
suspicious activity cannot be seen in its entirety; money
laundering by sending funds directly to a financial
organization from a foreign jurisdiction through an
international ACH payment; and high return rates from
unauthorized transactions.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are some ways money services businesses (MSBs) can be used for money laundering?</summary>

Money launderers can use money
remitters and currency exchanges to make
funds available to criminal organizations at a destination
country in the local currency. The launderer or broker then
sells the criminal dollars to foreign businesspeople wishing
to make legitimate purchases of goods for export. The cash-
intensive and transactional nature of MSBs can facilitate
money laundering.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are some of the aspects associated with the securities industry that increase its exposure to money laundering?</summary>

Its international nature; speed of
transactions; ability to conduct free-of-
payment transfers; ease of converting holdings to cash
without significant loss of principal; routine use of wire
transfers to, from, and through multiple jurisdictions;
competitive, commission-driven environment; practice of
maintaining securities accounts as nominees or trustees;
and weak AML programs.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are some red flags of money laundering associated with casinos and gambling?</summary>

Converting the funds to be laundered from
cash to checks and using casino credit to
layer transactions before transferring out the funds; buying
chips with illicit funds and requesting repayment via a
check drawn on the casino’s account; using illegal funds to
repay casino lines of credit; junket operators moving funds
across borders and through multiple casinos; paying
gambling debts in cash just under the reporting
requirements; engaging in minimal gambling without a
reasonable explanation; using casinos for banking-like
financial services; and unusual gaming and transaction
patterns.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why is gold vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist financing risks?</summary>

Gold has high intrinsic value in a compact
and easy-to-transport form. It can be
bought and sold simply and often anonymously for
currency in most areas of the world, allowing criminals to
convert their illicit cash into anonymous, transferable
assets. The gold market is a target for criminal activity
because it is lucrative and holds its value regardless of the
form it takes.

<details>
<summary>List ways in which travel agencies can be used to launder money.</summary>

Purchasing an expensive airline ticket for
another person, who then asks for a
refund; structuring wire transfers in small amounts to
avoid recordkeeping requirements; and establishing tour
operator networks with false bookings and documentation
to justify significant payments from foreign travel groups.

</details>

<details>
<summary>List various functions of gatekeepers—attorneys, notaries, accountants, and auditors—that can be useful to money launderers.</summary>

Creating and managing corporate vehicles
and other complex legal arrangements;
buying or selling property as a cover for illegal fund
transfers; performing financial transactions; providing
financial and tax advice; providing introductions to
financial organizations; undertaking certain litigation; and
setting up and managing charities.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why is the issue of requiring attorneys to be gatekeepers in the AML/CFT area controversial?</summary>

Attorneys have confidential relationships
with their clients.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What makes real estate an attractive channel for laundering illicit funds?</summary>

It can be purchased with cash; the ultimate
beneficial owner can be disguised; it is a
relatively stable and reliable investment; and the value can
be increased through renovations and improvements.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are some common money laundering techniques involved with trade-based money laundering?</summary>

Overinvoicing and underinvoicing;
overshipping and short-shipping; ghost-
shipping; shell companies; multiple invoicing; and black
market trades.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the Black Market Peso Exchange (BMPE)?</summary>

A form of trade-based money laundering,
the BMPE is a process by which money in
the United States derived from illegal activity is purchased
by peso brokers and deposited in US bank accounts
established by the brokers. The brokers sell checks and
wire transfers drawn on those accounts to legitimate
businesses, which use them to purchase goods and services
in the US. (Although the US is prominently figured in BMPE,
the process is not limited exclusively to that country.)

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are the potential risk factors commonly associated with prepaid bank cards?</summary>

Anonymous cardholders, anonymous
funding, anonymous access to funds, high
value limits and no limits on the number of cards
individuals can acquire; global access to cash through
ATMs; offshore card issuers that might not observe laws in
all jurisdictions; and use as a substitute for bulk-cash
smuggling.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are some specific controls that e-money institutions can implement to mitigate the money launderings risks of prepaid cards, mobile payments, and internet-based payment services?</summary>

Robust oversight of outsourced functions;
limits on storage values, transactions, and
turnover; transaction monitoring systems capable of
detecting money laundering patterns and deviations;
systems for identifying customers with multiple purses,
accounts, and cards; geolocation, device-related
information, and IP addresses to identify discrepancies in
customer activity from the information provided at
onboarding; cooperation with merchants that accept e-
money; geographic restrictions on the use and function of e-
money products.

<summary>What are some emerging risks for terrorist financing?</summary>

\Self-funding by foreign terrorist fighters;
raising funds through social media; new
payment products and services; and exploitation of natural
resources.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Explain the legal concept of willful blindness in the context of money laundering.</summary>

Willful blindness is the “deliberate
avoidance of knowledge of the facts” or
“purposeful indifference.” Courts have held that willful
blindness is the equivalent of actual knowledge of the illegal
source of funds or of the intentions of a customer in a
money laundering transaction.

</details>

<details>
<summary>In what ways is correspondent banking vulnerable to financial crime?</summary>

Correspondent banks do not know the
customers of the respondent directly and
rely on the respondent bank’s internal controls; less
information is available to help the correspondent bank
recognize unusual activity; the correspondent does not
know the degree of supervision to which the respondent is
subject, and might have limited information on the
respondent’s AML/CFT controls; and some respondents are
correspondents to third banks, which further shields the
parties involved.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is a concentration account?</summary>

Concentration accounts are internal
accounts established to facilitate the
processing and settlement of multiple or individual
customer transactions within the bank, usually on the same
day. They are frequently used to facilitate transactions for
private banking, trust and custody accounts, funds
transfers, and international affiliates.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Describe microstructuring.</summary>

Microstructuring is a method of placing
large amounts of illicit cash into the
financial system. It is essentially the same as structuring
(i.e., designing a transaction to evade reporting
requirements), but at a smaller level. A microstructurer
might take an $18,000 deposit and break it into 20 deposits
of approximately $900 each.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are the typical features of high-risk insurance products?</summary>

High-risk insurance products typically
offer the ability to fold funds and assets
into the policy; full or partial underlying investments under
the control of the customer; the option of asset transfers;
and a high upper limit for the amount of funds held.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How can art and antiques dealers and auctioneers mitigate their money laundering risks?</summary>

Require all art vendors to provide
identifying information and confirm that
they are authorized to sell the item; verify the identities and
addresses of new vendors and customers; report suspicious
items to the Art Loss Register; avoid cash payments; be
aware of money laundering regulations; and appoint a
senior staff member to whom employees can report
suspicious activities.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Describe several ways in which the investment and commodity advising industry is susceptible to money laundering.</summary>

Withdrawal of assets through transfers to
unrelated accounts or high-risk
jurisdictions; frequent additions to or withdrawals from
accounts; checks drawn on, or wire transfers from, accounts
of third parties with no relation to the client; clients who
request custodial arrangements that allow for anonymity;
transfers of funds to the adviser for management followed
by transfers to accounts at other institutions in a layering
scheme; investing illegal proceeds for a client; and
movement of funds to disguise their origin.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Describe the types of services that trust and company service providers (TCSPs) offer to third parties.</summary>

TCPSs can act as a formation agent of legal
persons; act as (or arrange for another
person to act as) a director or secretary of a company, a
partner of a partnership, or a similar position in relation to
other legal persons; provide a registered office, business
address, or correspondence for a company, partnership, or
another legal person or arrangement; act as (or arrange for
another person to act as) a trustee of an express trust; and
act as (or arrange for another person to act as) a nominee
shareholder for another person.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are four related purposes for establishing or controlling a shell company for money laundering?</summary>

Shell companies convert the cash proceeds
of crime into alternative assets; create the
perception that illicit funds were generated from a
legitimate source; facilitate a wide range of legitimate
and/or fake business transactions that can be used to
further the laundering process; and conceal criminal
ownership.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How can trust accounts be used to launder money? , whether offshore or onshore, in the context of money laundering?</summary>

A trust can be used to convert illicit cash
into less suspicious assets; help disguise
criminal ownership of funds and other assets; form an
essential link between different money laundering vehicles
and techniques, such as real estate, nominees, and the
deposit and transfer of criminal proceeds; and hide assets
from legitimate creditors and protect property from
seizure. Payments to the trust beneficiaries can be used to
launder money.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What makes bearer bonds, bearer stock certificates, and bearer shares prime vehicles for money laundering?</summary>

Bearer bonds, bearer stock certificates,
and bearer shares belong, on the surface,
to the “bearer.” When bearer securities are transferred,
because there is no registry of owners, the transfer takes
place by physically handing over the bonds or share
certificates. Bearer shares offer many opportunities to
disguise their legitimate ownership.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the basic difference between the crimes of terrorist financing and money laundering?</summary>

Terrorist financing uses funds for an illegal
political purpose, but the money is not
necessarily derived from illicit proceeds. On the other hand,
money laundering always involves the proceeds of illegal
activity. The purpose of laundering is to enable the money
to be used legally.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Describe factors that indicate a financial organization is at risk for being used as a conduit for terrorist financing?</summary>

Use of an account as a front for a person
with suspected terrorist links; appearance
of an account holder’s name on a list of suspected
terrorists; frequent, large cash deposits in accounts of
nonprofit organizations; high volumes of transactions in
accounts; and lack of a clear relationship between the
banking activity and the nature of the account holder's
business.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What makes hawalas attractive to terrorist financiers?</summary>

Unlike formal financial institutions,
hawalas are not subject to formal
government oversight and are not required to keep detailed
records in a standard form. Although some hawaladars do
keep ledgers, their records are often written in
idiosyncratic shorthand and are maintained only briefly

</details>

<details>
<summary>What characteristics of charities and nonprofit organizations make them particularly vulnerable to misuse for terrorist financing?</summary>

Enjoying the public trust; having access to
considerable sources of funds; being cash-
intensive; frequently having a global presence, often in or
near areas exposed to terrorist activity; and often being
subject to little or no regulation and/or having few
obstacles to their creation.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Describe the four types of risk associated with money laundering that are faced by financial organizations.</summary>

Reputational risk (the potential that
adverse publicity regarding an
organization’s business practices and associations will
cause a loss of public confidence in the integrity of the
organization), operational risk (the potential for loss
resulting from inadequate internal processes, personnel, or
systems), legal risk (the potential for lawsuits, adverse
judgments, unenforceable contracts, fines and penalties),
and concentration risk (the potential for loss resulting from
too much credit or loan exposure to one borrower or group
of borrowers).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Describe the three stages of money laundering.</summary>

Stage one: placement is the physical
disposal of cash or other assets derived
from criminal activity. Stage two: layering is the separation
of illicit proceeds from their source by layers of financial
transactions intended to conceal the origin of the proceeds.
Stage three: integration is supplying apparent legitimacy to
illicit wealth through the reentry of the funds into the
economy in what appears to be normal business or
personal transactions.

<details>
<summary>What motivated passage of the USA Patriot Act, and to whom does it apply?</summary>

The USA PATRIOT Act was motivated by
the terrorist attacks of September 11,
2001, and the urgent need to decipher and disable
mechanisms that finance terrorism, including strengthening
money laundering laws and the Bank Secrecy Act. The USA
PATRIOT Act has implications for US organizations and
non-US organizations that do business in the US.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What factors contribute to the vulnerabilities of private banking to money laundering?</summary>

Perceived high profitability; intense
competition; powerful clientele; high level
of confidentiality; close trust developed between
relationship managers and their clients; commission-based
compensation for relationship managers; culture of secrecy
and discretion; and role of relationship managers as client
advocates to protect their clients.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is one of the most important aspects of due diligence for a bank when establishing a relationship with a money services business (MSB)?</summary>

Confirm that the MSB has implemented a
sufficient AML/CFT program (e.g.,
procedures, training, and suspicious activity monitoring)
and is properly licensed and/or registered in the
jurisdictions in which it operates.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How can the free-look period in the insurance industry be used to launder money?</summary>

A free-look period is a feature that allows
investors, for a short period of time after
the policy is signed and the premium paid, to back out of a
policy without penalty. This process allows the money
launderer to get an insurance check, which represents
cleaned funds.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How can having a lawyer as a trustee on a client's account create vulnerabilities to money laundering at a financial organization?</summary>

When lawyers serve as trustees by holding
money or assets “in trust” for clients, it
enables the lawyers to conduct transactions and administer
the client's affairs. Sometimes, illicit money is placed in a
law firm’s general trust account in a file set up in the name
of the client, nominee, or a company controlled by the
client.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are some money laundering risks, methods, and red flags in the vehicle sales industry?</summary>

Structuring cash deposits below the
reporting threshold; purchasing vehicles
with sequentially numbered checks or money orders;
trading in vehicles and conducting successive transactions
of buying and selling new and used vehicles to produce
complex layers of transactions; and accepting third-party
payments, particularly from jurisdictions with ineffective
money laundering controls.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are some of the potential macroeconomic consequences of unchecked money laundering?</summary>

Increased exposure to organized crime
and corruption; undermining the
legitimate private sector; weakening financial
organizations; dampening effect on foreign investments;
loss of control of, or mistakes in, decisions regarding
economic policy; economic distortion and instability; loss of
tax revenue; risks to privatization efforts; reputation risk
for the country; risk of international sanctions; social costs;
reputational risk; operational risk; legal risk; and
concentration risk.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are bearer checks?</summary>

Bearer checks are unconditional orders
(i.e., negotiable instruments) that, when
presented to a financial organization, must be paid to the
holder of the instrument rather than to a payee specified on
the order itself. The financial organization is usually not
obligated to verify the identity of the presenter of a bearer
check unless the transaction exceeds a specific threshold.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are financial intelligence units (FIUs)?</summary>

FIUs are mandatory national agencies that
handle financial intelligence. They receive
reports of suspicious transactions from financial
organizations, other people, and entities, analyze them, and
disseminate the resulting intelligence to local law
enforcement agencies and foreign FIUs to combat money
laundering.

all dealers trading in goods who trade in cash over 15,000
euros; and it expands the definition of financial institution
to include certain insurance intermediaries.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How is a private banking account defined under Section 312 of the USA PATRIOT Act?</summary>

A private banking account is defined as an
account with a minimum aggregate
deposit of US$1 million; an account for one or more non-US
people; and an account that is assigned to a bank employee
acting as a liaison with the non-US person.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are the primary ways in which the EU’s Second Money Laundering Directive expanded the scope of the First Directive?</summary>

The EU’s Second Directive extended the
scope of the First Directive beyond drug-
related crimes; expanded the definition of “criminal
activity” to cover not just drug trafficking, but all serious
crimes; brought currency exchanges and money remittance
offices under AML coverage; clarified that knowledge of
criminal conduct can be inferred from objective factual
circumstances; provided a more precise definition of money
laundering; and widened the businesses and professions
that are subject to the obligations of the Directive.

</details>

<details>
<summary>According to Section 312 of the USA PATRIOT Act, the due diligence program for correspondent banks must address what three measures?</summary>

Determining whether enhanced due
diligence is necessary; assessing the
money laundering risk presented by the correspondent
account; and applying risk-based procedures and controls
reasonably designed to detect and report suspected money
laundering.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are the FATF-designated thresholds that should trigger AML scrutiny?</summary>

The threshold that financial organizations
should monitor for occasional customers is
US$15,000 [Recommendation 10]; for casinos, including
Internet casinos, it is US$3,000 [Recommendation 22]; and
for dealers in precious metals, when engaged in any cash
transaction, it is $US15,000 [Recommendations 22-23].

</details>

<details>
<summary>Describe FATF’s Recommendations regarding suspicious activity reporting.</summary>

Financial organizations must report to the
appropriate FIU when they suspect or
have reasonable grounds to suspect that funds are the
proceeds of a criminal activity or are related to terrorist
financing. The financial organizations and employees
reporting such suspicions should be protected from liability
for reporting and prohibited from disclosing that they have
reported such activity. Confidentiality concerning
suspicious activity reports (SARs) is critical to the effective
functioning of the reporting regime.

</details>

<details>
<summary>The Wolfsberg Group and the FATF recommend what enhanced due diligence before commencing or continuing a business relationship with high-risk customers?</summary>

For high-risk customers, both the
Wolfsberg Group’s Correspondent Banking
Principles and the FATF recommend obtaining the approval
of senior management to commence or continue the
business relationship, as well as requiring the first payment
to be carried out through an account in the customer’s
name with a bank subject to similar CDD standards.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Identify the seven topics of international standards incorporated into the FATF 40 Recommendations.</summary>

AML/CFT policies and coordination
[Recommendations 1-2]; money
laundering and confiscation [Recommendations 3-4];
terrorist financing and financing of proliferation
[Recommendations 5-8]; financial and nonfinancial
institution preventative measures [Recommendations 9-
23]; transparency and beneficial ownership of legal persons
and arrangements [Recommendations 24-25]; powers and
responsibilities of competent authorities and other
institutional measures [Recommendations 26-35]; and
international cooperation [Recommendations 36-40].

</details>

<details>
<summary>Describe FATF’s Recommendation concerning the risk-based approach.</summary>

Countries should start by identifying,
assessing, and understanding the money
laundering and terrorist financing risks they face. Then they
should take appropriate measures to mitigate the identified
risks. The risk-based approach allows countries to allocate
their limited resources in a targeted manner in line with
their own specific circumstances to increase the efficiency
of the preventative measures. Financial organizations
should also use a risk-based approach to identify and
mitigate their risks.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Differentiate between what are referred to as FATF's "black list" and "grey list."</summary>

Countries and jurisdictions on the "black
list" have strategic deficiencies that are so
serious that FATF calls on its members and nonmembers to
apply EDD and, in the most serious cases, countermeasures.
Countries and jurisdictions on the "grey list" are already
actively engaging with FATF to address strategic
deficiencies in their regimes to counter money laundering,
terrorist financing, and proliferation financing. Once a
jurisdiction is under increased monitoring, it means it has
committed to swiftly resolve the identified strategic
deficiencies within an agreed-upon time frame, while the
FATF keeps it under close scrutiny.

</details>

<details>
<summary>At a high level, what are the criteria for becoming a FATF Member?</summary>

The jurisdiction should be strategically
important based on quantitative (e.g., size
of GDP, population) and qualitative indicators (e.g., impact
on global financial system, level of AML/CFT risks faced)
and additional considerations (e.g., level of adherence to
financial sector standards), and FATF’s geographic balance
should be enhanced by the jurisdiction becoming a
member.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Does the Basel Committee prohibit the use of numbered accounts?</summary>

No, numbered accounts should not be
prohibited, but they should be subjected to
exactly the same KYC procedures as other customer
accounts. KYC tests may be carried out by select staff, but
the identity of customers must be known to an adequate
number of staff if the bank is to be sufficiently diligent.
“Such accounts should in no circumstances be used to hide
the customer identity from a bank’s compliance function or
from the supervisors.”

</details>

<details>
<summary>What must EU member countries do with the EU Directives?</summary>

EU members must transpose the
Directives into law.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What was considered a predicate offense for money laundering under the First EU Money Laundering Directive?</summary>

The First Directive of 1991 confined
predicate offenses of money laundering to
drug trafficking, as defined in the 1988 Vienna Convention.
However, member states were encouraged to extend the
predicate offenses to other crimes.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the revised threshold for reporting suspicious transactions under the Fourth EU Money Laundering Directive?</summary>

is the division of the U.S. Department of
Treasury that administers and enforces economic and trade
sanctions based on US foreign policy and national security
goals against targeted foreign countries, terrorists,
international narcotics traffickers, and criminals engaged in
activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction. OFAC imposes controls on transactions and
freezes foreign assets under US jurisdiction.

<summary>Describe the Wolfsberg Group's recommendation concerning a correspondent bank's due diligence on a respondent bank.</summary>

According to the Wolfsberg Group, a
bank’s due diligence on a respondent bank
should be based on the respondent’s risk profile and the
nature of the business relationship. Due diligence should
address specific risk indicators, such as the respondent
bank’s geographic risk, ownership and management
structures, customer base, and products and services
offered. Furthermore, the determination of the level and
scope of due diligence that is required on a respondent
bank should be made after considering the relationship
between the respondent bank and its ultimate parent (if
any).

<details>
<summary>According to the Basel Committee, what are the responsibilities of the board of directors related to AML/CFT compliance?</summary>

The board of directors plays a critical
oversight role. The board should approve
and oversee policies for risk, risk management, and
compliance. The board also should have a clear
understanding of the money laundering risks, including
timely, complete, and accurate information related to the
risk assessment. Along with senior management, the board
should appoint a qualified chief AML officer with overall
responsibility for the AML function and provide this officer
with sufficient resources to execute his responsibilities to
oversee compliance with the bank’s AML program.

<details>
<summary>According to the Basel Committee, how are sound KYC policies and procedures critical to protecting the safety and soundness of banks?</summary>

The Basel Committee’s KYC guidance
centers on the use of due diligence
requirements to mitigate the dangers of corrupt customers.
Without due diligence, banks can be subject to reputational,
operational, legal, and concentration risks, which can result
in significant financial cost. Sound KYC policies and
procedures are critical to protecting the safety and
soundness of banks, as well as the integrity of banking
systems.

<details>
<summary>What is the purpose of a memorandum of understanding in the context of financial intelligence units (FIUs) conducting investigations?</summary>

FIUs are tasked with receiving and
analyzing SARs and maintaining close links
with police and customs authorities. They share
information among themselves informally in the context of
investigations, usually on the basis of memoranda of
understanding. The Egmont Group of FIUs has established a
model for MOUs. They are not typically used for obtaining
evidence, but for obtaining intelligence that might lead to
evidence.

<details>
<summary>Why is it important for organizations to continue to update and revisit their AML/CFT risk assessments?</summary>

Risk is dynamic and needs to be
continuously managed, and the
environment in which each organization operates is subject
to continual change. Externally, the political changes of a
jurisdiction and whether economic sanctions are imposed
or removed can affect a country's risk rating. Internally,
organizations respond to market and customer demands by
merging or acquiring other companies, introducing new
products and services, and implementing new delivery
systems. The combination of these changes makes it critical
that the ML/TF risk model is subject to regular review. In
some countries, there is a legislative obligation for such
reviews to be undertaken on a regular basis.

</details>

<details>
<summary>According to FATF, what categories of risk factors warrant enhanced due diligence measures?</summary>

Customer risk factors (e.g., nonresident
customers, cash-intensive businesses,
complex ownership structure); country or geographic risks
(e.g., countries with inadequate AML/CFT systems,
countries subject to sanctions, countries involved with
funding or supporting of terrorist activities); and product,
service, transaction or delivery channel risk factors (e.g.,
private banking, anonymous transactions, payments
received from unknown third parties).

</details>

<details>
<summary>As a financial organization develops transaction history with its customers, what factors should lead it to consider modifying the risk rating of a customer?</summary>

Unusual activity, such as alerts, cases, and
suspicious activity (SAR) filings; receipt of
law enforcement inquiries, such as subpoenas; transactions
that violate economic sanctions programs; and significant
volumes of activity where it would not be expected.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are some sources for identifying high-risk countries?</summary>

The US State Department's annual
“International Narcotics Control Strategy
Report,” rating more than 100 countries on their money
laundering controls; Transparency International's yearly
“Corruption Perceptions Index,” which rates more than 100
countries on perceived corruption; FATF identifies
jurisdictions with weak AML/CFT regimes and issues
country-specific mutual evaluation reports; and in the US,
certain domestic jurisdictions are evaluated based on
whether they fall within government-identified higher-risk
geographic locations, such as high-intensity drug trafficking
areas (HIDTAs) and high-intensity financial crime areas
(HIFCAs).

</details>

<details>
<summary>In addition to policies and procedures, what are examples of internal controls with AML/CFT programs?</summary>

AML/CFT programs rely on a variety of
internal controls, including management
reports, automated review systems, and utilization of
multiple reviewers; the internal technology or tools the
financial organization uses to ensure the AML/CFT program
is functioning as intended and within predefined
parameters; the alert compliance department to identify
potential outliers and deviations from normal policy that
may need to be reviewed.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What factors should be considered when determining the level of sophistication of an organization's compliance function ?</summary>

The sophistication of the compliance
function should be based upon the
organization's nature, size, complexity, regulatory
environment, and the specific risks associated with its
products, services, and customers. No two organizations
will have exactly the same compliance structure, because
the risks facing each organization are different, as identified
in their respective risk assessments.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why is it important for an organization's AML/CFT compliance officer to have good communication skills?</summary>

The ability of the compliance officer to
communicate effectively, both in writing
and verbally, is vital to the success of an organization’s
AML/CFT program. The compliance officer must be able to
communicate at all levels of the organization—from front-
line associates to the CEO and board of directors. The
compliance officer needs to be capable of articulating
matters of importance to senior and executive
management. A compliance officer must be able to analyze
and interpret changes, determine what effect they could
have on the organization, and suggest an action plan, when
appropriate.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Describe an AML/CFT compliance officer's accountability.</summary>

Regardless of the way an organization
delegates its various AML/CFT tasks, its
designated compliance officer is responsible for executing
the AML/CFT program. More and more often, various
regulators are seeking enforcement actions against not only
the organization, its executive management team, and
board of directors for AML/CFT violations, but the
compliance officer as well.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are some of the target audiences for training?</summary>

Most areas of the financial organization
should receive AML/CFT training,
including customer-facing staff; operations personnel;
AML/CFT compliance staff; senior management and board
of directors; and independent testing staff. In some
countries, training programs must extend beyond full- and
part-time employees to include contractors, consultants,
students, apprentice placements, and secondees from other
branches or subsidiaries. E

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why are tests important in AML/CFT training?</summary>

Tests evaluate how well the training is
understood, with a mandatory passing
score.

</details>

<details>
<summary>When should a financial organization conduct training?</summary>

Training should be ongoing and on a
regular schedule. Existing employees
should at least attend an annual training session. New
employees should receive appropriate training with respect
to their job function and within a reasonable period after
joining or transferring to a new job. Situations may arise
that demand an immediate session or enhanced training.
Changes in software, systems, procedures, or regulations
are additional triggers for training sessions, as well as
specific illicit financial activity that affects a specific
business line or department.

</details>

<details>
<summary>According to FATF Recommendation 10, when should financial organizations undertake customer due diligence measures?</summary>

When establishing business relationships;
carrying out occasional transactions under
certain circumstances; when there is a suspicion of money
laundering or terrorist financing; and when the financial
organization has doubts about the veracity or adequacy of
previously obtained customer identification data.

</details>

<details>
<summary>According to FATF's Recommendation 10, when should a financial organization conduct enhanced due diligence (EDD) on a customer?</summary>

When there are circumstances in which
the risk of money laundering or terrorist
financing is higher, EDD measures should be taken. These
include customer risk factors; country or geographic risk
factors; and product, service, transaction, and delivery
channel risk factors.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are examples of information obtained when a financial organization conducts enhanced due diligence on high-risk customers?</summary>

Source of funds and wealth; identifying
information on individuals with control
over the account, such as signatories or guarantors;
occupation or type of business; financial statements;
banking references; domicile; proximity of the customer’s
residence, place of employment, and place of business to
the bank; description of the customer’s primary trade area
and whether international transactions are expected;
description of the business operations, the anticipated
volume of currency and total sales; a list of major customers
and suppliers; explanations for changes in account activity.

</details>

<details>
<summary>According to FATF Recommendation 10, when should the identity of a customer be established and verified?</summary>

A bank should not establish a banking
relationship or carry out any transactions
until the identity of the customer has been satisfactorily
established and verified in accordance with FATF
Recommendation 10.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How should a global financial organization address the performance of customer due diligence across its various operations?</summary>

Financial organizations should aim to
apply their customer acceptance policy,
procedures for customer identification, process for
monitoring high-risk accounts and risk-management
framework on a global basis to all of their offices, branches
and subsidiaries. The organization should clearly
communicate these policies and procedures through
ongoing training and regular communications, and conduct
monitoring and testing to ensure compliance with the
policies and procedures.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the name of the Office of Foreign Assets Control’s (OFAC) sanctions list?</summary>

The Specially Designated Nationals and
Blocked Persons (SDN) list.

</details>

<details>
<summary>When should a financial organization conduct sanctions screening?</summary>

Before a financial organization starts
doing business with a new customer or
engaging in certain transactions, it should review the
various country sanctions program requirements and
published lists of known or suspected terrorists, narcotics
traffickers, and other criminals, for potential matches.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is a limitation of using publicly available sources of information to identify politically exposed persons (PEPs) and their associations?</summary>

These lists do not provide all relevant
information related to PEPs that would
assist in identifying them. For example, they do not include
unique identifiers, such as date of birth or address, which
poses significant operational constraints, particularly at
large retail financial organizations.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are the basic elements, or four pillars, of an effective AML/CFT program?</summary>

A system of internal policies, procedures
and controls (first line of defense); a
designated compliance function with a compliance officer
(second line of defense); an ongoing employee training
program; and an independent audit function to test the
overall effectiveness of the AML program (third line of
defense).

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are the responsibilities of a financial organization's AML compliance officer?</summary>

The AML compliance officer is responsible
for managing all aspects of the AML/CFT
compliance program. This includes, but is not limited to,
designing and implementing the program, making
necessary changes and updates, disseminating information
about the program’s successes and failures to key staff
members, constructing AML/CFT-related content for staff
training programs, and managing the organization’s
adherence to applicable AML/CFT laws and regulations,
including staying current on legal and regulatory
developments in the field.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are the components of an effective AML/CFT training program?</summary>

An effective training program explains the
relevant AML/CFT laws and regulations
and covers the organizations’ policies and procedures used
to mitigate money laundering risks. Training should
emphasize the importance of AML/CFT efforts and educate
employees about what to do if they encounter potential
money laundering.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are the basic questions to ask when developing an AML/CFT compliance training program?</summary>

Who to train? What training topics? How
to train? When to train? Where to train?

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is involved in the independent audit's review of case management and suspicious activity reporting (SAR) systems?</summary>

The independent audit's review of case
management and SAR systems should
include an evaluation of the research and referral of
unusual transactions and a review of policies, procedures,
and processes for referring unusual and suspicious activity
from all business lines to the personnel responsible for
investigating it.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What steps should the independent audit take to evaluate the ability of transaction monitoring software to identify unusual activity?</summary>

Review policies, procedures, and
processes for suspicious activity
monitoring; review the processes for ensuring the
completeness, accuracy, and timeliness of the data supplied
by the source transaction processing systems; evaluate the
methodology for establishing and analyzing expected
activity and filtering criteria; evaluate the appropriateness
of the monitoring reports; and compare the transaction
monitoring typologies with the AML/CFT risk assessment
for reasonableness.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What banking functions and products are considered high- risk?</summary>

Private banking; offshore international
activity; deposit-taking facilities; wire
transfer and cash-management functions; transactions in
which the primary beneficiary is undisclosed; loan
guarantee schemes; travelers checks; official bank checks;
money orders; foreign exchange transactions; international
remittances; payment services such as payment processors,
prepaid products, automatic clearing house; remote deposit
capture; trade-financing transactions with unusual pricing
features; and payable through accounts.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are the four levels of AML/CFT risk?</summary>

Prohibited: The organization will not
tolerate any dealings of any kind, given the
risk.
High risk: Risks are significant, but they are not necessarily
prohibited.
Medium risk: Risks merit additional scrutiny, but they do
not rise to the level of high-risk.
Low risk: The baseline risk of money laundering. Typically
indicates normal, expected activity.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What types of customers do supervisory authorities identify as inherently high-risk for money laundering?</summary>

Banks; casinos; offshore corporations and
banks located in tax/banking havens;
embassies; MSBs, including currency exchange houses,
money remitters, check cashers; virtual currency
exchanges; car, boat, and airplane dealerships; used car and
truck dealers and machine parts manufacturers;
professional service providers (e.g., attorneys, accountants,
investment brokers, and other third parties who act as
financial liaisons for their clients); travel agencies; broker-
dealers in securities; jewel, gem, and precious metals
dealers; import and export companies; and cash-intensive
businesses.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Where does the ultimate responsibility for a financial organization's AML/CFT program lie?</summary>

The ultimate responsibility for the
AML/CFT program lies with the board of
directors. Members must set the tone from the top by
openly voicing their commitment to the program, ensuring
that their commitment flows through all service areas and
lines of business, and holding responsible parties
accountable for compliance.

</details>

<summary>Identify several types of internal reports financial organizations can use to discover possible money laundering and terrorist financing.</summary>

Daily cash activity exceeding the country’s
reporting threshold; daily cash activity just
below the country’s reporting threshold; cash activity
aggregated over a period of time (e.g., individual
transactions over a certain amount or totaling more than a
certain amount over a 30-day period, to identify possible
structuring); wire transfer reports/logs with filters using
amounts and geographical factors; monetary instrument
logs/reports; check kiting/drawing on uncollected funds
with significant debit/credit flows; significant change
reports; and new account activity reports.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Describe the components of a typical suspicious or unusual transaction reporting process within a financial organization as part of its AML/CFT program.</summary>

Procedures to identify suspicious and
unusual transactions and activity through
various channels, including employee observations and
identification, inquiries from law enforcement, and alerts
generated by transaction monitoring systems; formal
evaluation of each instance and continuation of unusual
transactions and activity; documentation of the SAR
reporting decision (i.e., whether or not a report was filed
with authorities); procedures to periodically notify senior
management or the board of directors of SAR filings; and
employee training on detecting suspicious transactions and
activity.

<details>
<summary>What is a search warrant, and how is it issued?</summary>

A search warrant is a grant of permission
from a court for a law enforcement agency
to search certain designated premises and seize specific
categories of items or documents. Generally, the requesting
agency is required to establish that probable cause exists
that evidence of a crime will be located. The warrant is
authorized based on information contained in an affidavit
submitted by a law enforcement officer.

<details>
<summary>ABC Bank was served with a subpoena compelling the production of certain documents on a personal checking account. What are the first steps the bank should take after being served with the subpoena?</summary>

The organization should ensure its senior
management and/or legal counsel reviews
the subpoena and independently confirms its legitimacy
(e.g., to confirm that it is not an attempted fraud to obtain
confidential information). If there are no grounds for
contesting the subpoena, the organization should take all
appropriate measures to comply with the summons or
subpoena on a timely and complete basis. The financial
organization should never notify the customer being
investigated.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How should a financial organization monitor the receipt of a subpoena, summons, or other requests from government agencies?</summary>

Financial organizations should ensure that
all grand jury subpoenas and other
information requests from government agencies are
reviewed by senior management and an investigations
group or legal counsel to determine how best to respond to
the inquiry and whether the inquiry or the underlying
activity might pose a risk to the organization. In addition,
the organization should maintain centralized control over
all requests and responses to ensure that it responds to
requests on a complete and timely basis and maintains a
complete record of information provided. This centralized
record will also assist in the organization’s internal
investigation.

</details>

<details>
<summary>If a financial organization is under investigation by a government agency, what information should it give employees?</summary>

Employees should be informed of the
investigation and instructed not to directly
produce corporate documents. Rather, they should inform
senior management or counsel of all requests for
documentation and provide the documents to them for
production. In that way, the organization knows what is
being requested and what has been produced. In addition,
the organization can determine what, if any, requests
should be contested. The same procedure should be
followed with requests for employee interviews.

</details>

<details>
<summary>In what ways can a financial organization cooperate with law enforcement during an investigation?</summary>

Providing investigators with the
information they need to reach an
investigative conclusion might be the most effective way to
terminate an investigation before it has a devastating effect
on the resources and reputation of an organization.
Cooperation could include making employees, including
corporate officers, available for interviews, and producing
documents without the requirement of a subpoena. It could
also include a voluntary disclosure by providing
investigators with any report written by counsel regarding
the subject under investigation.

</details>

<details>
<summary>In an internal investigation, who exactly does the attorney for the organization represent?</summary>

In an internal investigation, attorneys for
the organization represent the entity and
not its employees. Counsel should understand these issues
and conduct the internal investigation accordingly. Work
product and communications might be protected under
attorney-client privilege. There can be serious
consequences when the interests of an entity and its
employees diverge or conflict, and when an employee
implicates the employer, or vice versa. In such cases,
separate counsel could be required.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Following an investigation, a financial organization decides to file a suspicious activity report (SAR). What should they do as soon as possible?</summary>

Notify the investigators or prosecutors.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What types of documents do financial organizations typically have that could assist a financial investigator in tracking money movements?</summary>

Banks maintain signature cards, which are
collected at the opening of an account,
account statements, deposit tickets, checks and withdrawal
items, and credit and debit memorandums. They also keep
records on loans, cashier’s checks, certified checks,
traveler’s checks, and money orders. They exchange
currency, cash third-party checks, and conduct wire
transfers, as do most MSBs. Financial organizations also
keep safe deposit boxes and issue credit cards. Online-
based financial organizations maintain login activity logs, IP
addresses, and geographical location information.

</details>

<details>
<summary>During a law enforcement investigation against a financial organization, why is it important to interview knowledgeable employees as soon as practical?</summary>

It is important to interview these
employees as soon as practicable so that
their memories are fresh, and they can direct management
or counsel to relevant documents and people on a timely
basis.

</details>

<details>
<summary>When counsel for a financial organization prepares a written report of an investigation, what steps should the organization take to retain the attorney-client privilege?</summary>

The organization should take steps to not
inadvertently waive the attorney-client
privilege by distributing the report to persons who should
not receive it. Every page of the report should contain a
statement that it is confidential and is subject to the
attorney-client privilege and work-product privilege.
Copies of the report should be numbered, and a list of
people who are given copies to read should be maintained.
After a set period of time, all copies should be returned.
Individuals who receive the report should be instructed not
to make notes on their copies. All copies should be
maintained in a file separate from regular organization files
to maintain the highest level of protection.

</details>

<details>
<summary>According to the Egmont Group, what best practices should be observed by an FIU requesting information from another FIU?</summary>

All FIUs should submit requests for
information in compliance with the
Principles of Information Exchange. When applicable, the
provisions of information-sharing arrangements among
FIUs should also be observed. Requests for information
should be submitted as soon as the precise assistance
required is identified. When an FIU has information that
might be useful to another FIU, it should consider supplying
it spontaneously as soon as the relevance of sharing this
information is identified. The exchange of information
among Egmont FIUs should take place in a secure way. To
this end, the Egmont FIUs should use the Egmont Secure
Web (ESW) when appropriate.

<details>
<summary>What is meant by a country’s "extraterritorial reach?"</summary>

The extension of one country’s policies
and laws to the citizens and organizations
of another. US AML laws contain several provisions that
extend its prohibitions and sanctions into other countries.
For example, the “extraterritorial jurisdiction” of the
principal US AML law can apply to a non-US citizen if the
“conduct” occurs “in part” in the US (Title 18, USC Sec.
1956(f)).

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is an international business company (IBC)?</summary>

IBCs are entities formed outside a person’s

<details>
<summary>Describe Know Your Customer (KYC).</summary>

KYC refers to anti-money laundering
policies and procedures used to determine
the true identity of a customer and the type of activity that
is normal and expected, and to detect activity that is
unusual for a particular customer. Many experts believe
that a sound KYC program is one of the best tools in an
effective AML/CFT program.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is a mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT)?</summary>

When evidence is required from another
jurisdiction, a request can be made for
mutual legal assistance. MLATs provide a legal basis for
transmitting evidence that can be used for prosecution and
judicial proceedings. MLATs only involve two countries at a
time.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is meant by the "physical cross-border transportation of currency"?</summary>

The physical cross-border transportation
of currency refers to any inbound or
outbound transportation of currency or bearer negotiable
instruments from one country to another. The term

A warning signal that should bring the
attention of a financial organization to a
potentially suspicious transaction or activity.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are remittance services?</summary>

Remittance services are also referred to as
giro houses or casas de cambio. They are
businesses that receive cash or other funds that they
transfer through the banking system to another account.
The account is held by an associated company in a foreign
jurisdiction, where the money is made available to the
ultimate recipient.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is a safe harbor for reporting suspicious activity?</summary>

Safe harbor is legal protection for financial
organizations, their directors, officers, and
employees from criminal and civil liability for breach of any
restriction on disclosing information imposed by contract
or by any legislative, regulatory, or administrative
prohibition, if they report their suspicions in good faith to
the financial intelligence unit, even if they did not know
precisely what the underlying criminal activity was, and
regardless of whether illegal activity actually occurred.

<summary>What is willful blindness?</summary>

A legal principle that operates in money
laundering cases and is defined by courts
as the “deliberate avoidance of knowledge of the facts” or
“purposeful indifference.” Courts have held that willful
blindness is the equivalent of actual knowledge of the illegal
source of funds or of the intentions of a customer in a
money laundering transaction.
