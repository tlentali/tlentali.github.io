I am a Data Scientist at [Betclic](https://www.betclic.fr/), specializing in developing machine learning models for detecting patterns related to anti-money laundering (AML) and safer gaming, particularly identifying gambling addiction risks. I hold a [CAMS certification](https://www.acams.org/en), reinforcing my expertise in financial crime prevention. Previously, I worked at [Cdiscount](https://www.cdiscount.com/), a leading French e-commerce company, where I focused on enhancing search engine relevancy.

My academic background is in applied mathematics, with a Master’s degree emphasizing [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), [operations research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research) and [optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization). I studied at [Bordeaux](https://www.u-bordeaux.fr/) and [Toulon](https://www.univ-tln.fr/) universities in France, where I explored a combination of pure and applied mathematics, economics, and computer science. My passion for data science took off in 2015 during an internship at [Idaia Group](https://www.idaia.group/en/), where I participated in a [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) competition on DataScience.net.

Beyond my professional work, I am deeply involved in programming and [open-source projects](https://github.com/tlentali). I take pride in earning the [Kaggle competitions Expert](https://www.kaggle.com/tlentali) title and enjoy competitive data science. I also contribute to the community by helping peers on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/8479387/tlentali) and sharing my knowledge as a lecturer, teaching AI & Ethics at [Kedge Business School](https://kedge.edu/) and Python programming at [INSEEC](https://www.inseec.com/en/) Bordeaux.

Outside of work, I’m an avid surfer, motorcycle enthusiast, and hands-on tinkerer—often found soldering electronics. I also indulge my love for gastronomy by reviewing restaurants in Bordeaux.
